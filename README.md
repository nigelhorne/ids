Magnific Popup http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/

# TODO

* CSSify all pages.

* Thumbnails and Image::Info

* Better presentation of the actual pages with photographs.
Use the caption option of magnific-popup
Look into http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/ (single image pop-up)

* Finish print.css
