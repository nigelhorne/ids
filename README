IDS is a perl script that generates a multi-album image gallery on the fly. All
you need to provide are the images and (optionally) text descriptions. It uses
HTML template sets called "themes" so you can customize the look of your site.

IDS supports subdirectories, so you can create albums inside of albums. Albums 
can be symbolic links to directories outside of the IDS directory. Albums 
will be displayed with an icon featuring an image from the album.

IDS creates thumbnails for JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and GIF images. It can be configured
to display generic icons for other types of files.

It has a web-based administrative interface so that you may:
    - edit IDS' preferences
    - upload, delete, rename, rotate, or caption images 
    - create, rename, and caption albums 
    - create, modify, or delete news items
    - view the size of and delete the image-cache
    - view IDS' logs
    - choose the image that appears in an album's icon

Images can be placed directly into directories within the "albums" directory if 
you do not wish to use the administrative interface.

IDS requires: 
    - a webserver 
    - Perl
    - ImageMagick w/ PerlMagick
    - the Image::Info Perl module
      (NOTE: v1.12 has been known to cause problems - use included v1.11 under delegates)

IDS has been tested under Redhat Linux 7.x, 6.2, FreeBSD 4.2, OpenBSD 2.8, and Mac 
OS X with Apache, and Windows 2000 with IIS, but may work under other OS's or 
webservers after some modifications.

If you use the Shutterfly logo in a modified version of this script or your 
own script, you must follow these Shutterfly guidelines:
    - use it as-is
    - use it on a white background
    - only use it on pages where the visitor can order prints
