<b>IDS</b> (Image Display System) is a CGI written in Perl that interactively generates a photo album website. All you need to provide are the images and (optionally) text descriptions. As you add new pictures, they will appear automatically. Each image will be displayed with information such as image type, file size, image size, and date uploaded. If EXIF information is embedded in the image (shutter speed, aperture, focal length, etc.), it will be displayed.
